## Question 1

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

## Including all libraries needed 
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)

## Setting the working directory and assiging 
setwd("C:/Users/Zachary/Desktop")
activity <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Zachary/Desktop/activity.csv")
stepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)

## Creating the histogram 
hist(stepsPerDay, xlab="Number of Steps", main="Histogram: Steps per Day")

## Calculating the mean and median for the total number of steps taken
meanPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)
medianPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)
