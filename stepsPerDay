# Question 1 - What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

### Including all libraries needed 
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
setwd("C:/Users/Zachary/Desktop")

## Load Activity Monitoring Data
activity <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/Zachary/Desktop/activity.csv")

## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(stepsPerDay, xlab="Number of Steps", main="Histogram: Steps per Day")

## Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
meanPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)
medianPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay, na.rm=TRUE)

The mean and median number of steps per day are 1.076618910^[4] and 10765
