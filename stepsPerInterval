# Question 2 - What is the average daily activity pattern?

##Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all dats
stepsPerInterval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)
plot(as.numeric(names(stepsPerInterval)), stepsPerInterval, xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps", main="Average Daily Activity Pattern", type='l')

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
maxInterval <- names(sort(stepsPerInterval, decreasing = TRUE)[1])
maxSteps <- sort(stepsPerInterval, decreasing = TRUE)[1]

The interval associated with maxiumum activity is interval 835, at 206.1698113 steps
