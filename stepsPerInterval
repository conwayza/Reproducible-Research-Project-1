## Question 2 

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

## Assigning information to variable to plot 
stepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum)

## Plotting the information in stepsPerDay 
plot(as.numeric(names(stepsPerInterval)), stepsPerInterval, xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps", main="Average Daily Activity Pattern", type='l')

## Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
maxInterval <- names(sort(stepsPerInterval, decreasing = TRUE)[1])
maxSteps <- sort(stepsPerInterval, decreasing = TRUE)[1]
