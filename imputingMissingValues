# Q3 - Imputing Missing Values

## Calulate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
NA.vals <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))

There are 2304 missing values in this data set

## Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset

I'll fill in missing data with the mean number of steps across all days with available data for that particular interval

## Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
stepsPerInterval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
activity.split <- split(activity, activity$interval)
for (i in 1:length(activity.split)) {
     activity.split[[i]]$steps[is.na(activity.split[[i]]$steps)] <- stepsPerInterval[i]
    }
activity.imputed <- do.call("rbind", activity.split)
activity.imputer <- activity.imputed[order(activity.imputed$date) ,]

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
stepsPerDay.imputed <- tapply(activity.imputed$steps, activity.imputed$date, sum)
hist(stepsPerDay.imputed, xlab="Number of Steps", main="Histogram: Steps per Day (Imputed Data)")

meanPerDay.imputed <- mean(stepsPerDay.imputed, na.rm = TRUE)
medianPerDay.imputed <- median(stepsPerDay.imputed, na.rm = TRUE)

The mean and median number of steps per day including imputed data are 1.076618910^[4] and 1.076618910^[4]. The mean remains the 
same as prior to imputation, while the median value increased slightly
